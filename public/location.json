As the project progressed, it slowly dawned on us- not only have we offered the ultimate luxury in the Bangladeshi hospitality industry, we have also offered the finest facilities in all of the Indian Subcontinent. We have included many Bangladeshi firsts - heated, salt water, and best of all, hanging, and partially transparent, infinity pool, a 119 feet tall mosaic mural, and a state-of-the-art heating and water filtration system for the whole building. To that we have added jaw-dropping features- glass floor on our Sky Pool Bar, a spectacular rooftop private dining room, and some mouth-watering culinary options, among them a live Teppanyaki show and a sushi bar. Six Seasons is an extraordinary hotel that offers every indulgence. With per room expenditure matching or exceeding ultra-luxury hotels chains around the world, you would not expect any less than the finest. At Six Seasons Hotel, we redefine luxury.",
